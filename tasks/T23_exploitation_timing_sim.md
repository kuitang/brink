# T23: Exploitation Timing Analysis Simulation

## Task ID
T23

## Title
Create simulation to find optimal defection turn

## Description
Build a simulation that answers: "If I cooperate for N turns then defect, what's my expected payoff?" This is critical for validating that the capture mechanics don't create a dominant "late defection" strategy.

## Blocked By
- T09 (Balance sim dual metrics - builds on that infrastructure)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Script `scripts/exploitation_timing_sim.py` exists
- [ ] Simulates games where Player A defects exactly once at turn N
- [ ] Varies N from 1 to 14
- [ ] Measures:
  - Total VP captured by Player A (surplus + position)
  - Win rate for Player A
  - Average total value created
- [ ] Outputs table showing payoff by defection turn
- [ ] Identifies "optimal defection turn" (peak payoff)
- [ ] Flags WARNING if optimal turn is 12+ (late defection dominance)

## Expected Output
```

================================================================================
Defect Turn | Avg Surplus | Avg Position | Total VP | Win Rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1      |     0.8     |     3.5      |   53.2   |   48%
     2      |     1.6     |     3.2      |   54.1   |   50%
     ...
     7      |     6.4     |     2.1      |   58.7   |   56%   <- PEAK
     ...
    14      |    18.0     |     0.8      |   52.1   |   44%

Optimal defection turn: 7 (mid-game) ✓
```

## Action If Late Defection Dominates
If optimal turn is 12+, enable STREAK_PROTECTION in parameters.py:
```python
STREAK_PROTECTION_RATE = 0.5
MAX_PROTECTED_STREAK = 10
```
